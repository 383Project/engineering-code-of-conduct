# Engineering Code Of Conduct

Welcome to this comprehensive document that covers all critical processes within Engineering development. As you read through, you will find a detailed description of the engineering processes of the engineering development lifecycle. This document outlines the essential steps that are involved in the development of engineering projects, ensuring that you have a clear understanding of each phase.

We have also included an in-depth explanation of risk process assessments, highlighting their importance in mitigating potential project risks. Additionally, we provide you with a thorough understanding of the basic operating procedures for engineering, ensuring that you have a solid foundation for successful project completion.

Furthermore, we have included information on the best secure coding practices that are essential in maintaining the security and integrity of your engineering projects. This document is designed to provide you with a complete understanding of all the critical processes involved in engineering development, ensuring that you have the knowledge and skills needed to successfully complete your engineering projects.

## Table of contents

- ### The Development Lifecycle
  The engineering lifecycle refers to the series of processes and activities that an engineering project undergoes from its conceptualization and design to its development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.    

  - #### Discovery
    Discovery in the engineering lifecycle refers to the initial phase of the project where requirements are gathered, the problem is defined, and the feasibility of the project is assessed to determine whether it is worth pursuing. The following information for discovery is for a guide purpose only as not every project requires these documents this varies to a project complexity and needs. 
    
    - [Process of creating a formal estimation](/)
    - [Process of creating a formal infrastructure quote](/)
    - [Creation of Software requirements specification](/)
    - [Creation of Network Diagrams](/)
    - [Creation of Flow Diagrams](/)
  
  - #### Build
    Build in the engineering lifecycle refers to the phase where the design and development of the project take place, including the creation of prototypes and the implementation of software and hardware.
    
    - [Version Control Guide](/)
    - [Code Review Guide](/)
    - [Secure Coding Practices Guide](/)
    - [Development Environments Guide](/)
    - [Deployment Guide](/)
    
    As this document covers the minimum global requirements of the whole engineering team futher processes and operation information can be seen an a granular level in the following areas:
    - [Backend Engineering Team Operation Guide](/)
    - [Frontend Engineering Team Operation Guide](/)
  
  - #### Quality Control
    Quality Control in the engineering lifecycle refers to the process of ensuring that the final product or solution meets the expected standards, specifications, and requirements through various testing and inspection methods.
    
     As this document covers the minimum global requirements of the whole engineering team futher processes and operation information can be seen an a granular level in the following areas:
    - [Quality Assurance Team Operation Guide](/)

  - #### Deployment
    Deployment in the engineering lifecycle refers to the phase where the final product or solution is released, installed, and made available for use by the end-users, including the necessary training, documentation, and support to ensure a successful adoption.
    
    As this document covers the minimum global requirements of the whole engineering team futher processes and operation information can be seen an a granular level in the following areas:
    - [Support Team Operation Guide](/)
  
  - #### Support
    Support in the engineering lifecycle refers to the ongoing maintenance and enhancement of the product or solution, including bug fixes, upgrades, and additional features, to ensure that it continues to meet the changing needs and requirements of the end-users.
