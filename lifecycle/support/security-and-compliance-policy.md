# Security and Compliance Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of this Security and Compliance Policy for Engineering Support Team is to establish guidelines and procedures for maintaining the security and compliance of our systems and applications. This policy covers the areas of intrusion detection, server clock synchronization, vulnerability management, required application security knowledge, vulnerability logging, and timelines for notification and response.

## Scope

This policy applies to all members of the Engineering Support Team, including system administrators, network administrators, and other IT personnel responsible for maintaining the security and compliance of our systems and applications.

## Intrusion Detection

The Engineering Support Team is responsible for implementing and maintaining an effective intrusion detection system to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. This includes monitoring network traffic, system logs, and other security events to detect and respond to potential security incidents. The following procedures should be followed:

- Implement an intrusion detection system to monitor network traffic and system logs for potential security incidents.
- Define and implement incident response procedures to respond to potential security incidents in a timely and effective manner.
- Regularly review intrusion detection logs to identify potential security incidents and take appropriate action.

## Server Clock on Servers

All servers must be synchronized to a reliable time source to ensure accurate timestamping of security events. The Engineering Support Team is responsible for configuring and maintaining the time synchronization settings on all servers. The following procedures should be followed:

- Configure all servers to synchronize with a reliable time source.
- Regularly check the time synchronization settings on all servers to ensure that they are functioning properly.
- Address any time synchronization issues promptly to ensure accurate timestamping of security events.

## Vulnerability Management

The Engineering Support Team is responsible for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in our systems and applications to ensure their security and compliance. This includes regularly scanning for vulnerabilities, prioritizing and addressing identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact, and ensuring that security patches and updates are promptly applied to our systems. The following procedures should be followed:

- Implement a vulnerability management program to regularly scan for vulnerabilities in our systems and applications.
- Prioritize and address identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.
- Ensure that security patches and updates are promptly applied to our systems.
- Regularly review vulnerability management logs to identify potential vulnerabilities and take appropriate action.

## Required Application Security Knowledge

The Engineering Support Team is required to have a strong understanding of application security principles and practices, including secure coding practices, secure configuration management, and secure software development lifecycles. They should also stay up to date with the latest security threats and vulnerabilities, and be familiar with relevant security standards and regulations. The following procedures should be followed:

- Implement a training program to ensure that all members of the Engineering Support Team have a strong understanding of application security principles and practices.
- Regularly review and update the training program to ensure that it reflects the latest security threats and vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that all members of the Engineering Support Team are familiar with relevant security standards and regulations.

## Vulnerability Logging

All identified vulnerabilities must be logged and tracked to ensure that they are properly addressed in a timely manner. The following information should be collected for each vulnerability:

- Description of the issue
- Date, time, and location of the issue
- Person who discovered the issue
- How the issue was discovered
- Known evidence of the issue
- The affected system(s)
- Affected number of users

## Timelines for Notification and Response

The Engineering Support Team is responsible for promptly notifying relevant stakeholders of security incidents or vulnerabilities and responding to them in a timely manner. The following timelines should be followed:

- High severity incidents or vulnerabilities: immediate notification and response
