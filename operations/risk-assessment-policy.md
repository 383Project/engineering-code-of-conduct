#Risk assessment policy to be created, the following are just notes to cover.

The risk assessment carried out as part of the development process considers the following:

user authentication requirements,
access provisioning and authorisation processes, for business users as well as for privileged or technical users,
informing users and operators of their duties and responsibilities, 
the required protection needs of the assets being developed (availability, confidentiality, integrity),
requirements derived from business processes, such as transaction logging and monitoring, non-repudiation requirements,
requirements mandated by other security controls, e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems.
