# Annual Leave Checklist

When planning for annual leave, it's crucial for team members to ensure a smooth transition both during the leave and upon return. This checklist provides a comprehensive guide to help team members prepare for their leave.

## Checklist

1. **Team Awareness and Booking**:
   - It's the individual's responsibility to ensure the team is aware of upcoming annual leave. Mention your upcoming leave in an engineering standup prior to the leave.
   - Ensure that the annual leave is booked correctly within Bamboo HR.
   - As a courtesy, drop a team reminder the day before your leave, indicating your return date so the team knows the duration of your absence.

2. **Cover for Leads and Line Managers**:
   - If you approve timesheets, ensure you appoint a colleague to cover this duty in your absence.
   - For leads responsible for sign-offs on the scope of work and SLA agreements, delegate this responsibility to a competent team member during your leave.

3. **Work Handover**:
   - Prepare a comprehensive handover document detailing the following:
     - **Key Dates and Times**: Specify any important dates and times that the team should be aware of during your absence.
     - **Timelines**: Clearly outline any timelines that need to be followed for ongoing or upcoming projects.
     - **Risks or Concerns**: Highlight any potential risks or concerns that might arise during your leave.
     - **Tagging Individuals**: Physically tag and name people in the document to clearly designate responsibility and ensure they are aware of their tasks.
   - Communicate the handover through email and ensure you verbally walk the designated colleague(s) through the document to address any questions or clarifications.
   - The Head of Engineering should be informed and made aware of your handovers in case of emergencies.

4. **Communication**:
   - Set up an out-of-office notification on your email, indicating the duration of your leave and providing an alternative contact person for urgent matters.
   - Update your Slack status to reflect that you're on leave.
   - Inform key stakeholders, clients, or partners about your leave and introduce them to the colleague who will be their point of contact.

5. **Calendar Management**:
   - Ensure your calendar is marked as away for the duration of your leave. This will auto-decline incoming invites and notify colleagues of your unavailability.

6. **Documentation & Google Suite**:
   - Ensure all important documents and resources are stored in a shared drive or repository in Google Suite.
   - Confirm that the documents have been shared with the correct people and they have the necessary access permissions.

7. **Code Management**:
   - If you are writing code, make sure anything that's not finished is committed to a branch, ensuring work is not lost.

8. **Digital Product Development Tasks (if applicable)**:
   - Ensure that all active development tasks are either completed or in a stable state.
   - Update the project management tool with the status of your tasks and any necessary notes.
   - Notify the Quality Assurance team of any pending reviews or tests.

9. **Meetings and Appointments**:
   - Reschedule any meetings or appointments that fall during your leave period.
   - If necessary, delegate a colleague to attend meetings on your behalf.

10. **Timesheets**:
   - Submit your timesheets before commencing your leave.

11. **Return Preparation**:
   - List tasks or meetings that you'll need to prioritise upon your return.
   - Consider scheduling a catch-up meeting with your manager or team lead for the day you return to get updated on any developments.

12. **Feedback and Improvements**:
   - After returning from leave, reflect on the handover process and identify any areas for improvement to refine the process for future instances.
