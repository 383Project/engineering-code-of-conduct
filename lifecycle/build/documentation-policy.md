# Documentation Policy

[<< Return to code of conduct homepage](https://github.com/383Project/engineering-code-of-conduct)

At 383 Project, we believe that good documentation is essential for the success of any project. It ensures that knowledge is shared, progress is tracked, and that stakeholders have a clear understanding of what has been done and what still needs to be accomplished. This policy sets out the guidelines for creating and maintaining project documentation, including the structure and format to be followed, and the tools and resources available to assist engineers in this task.

## 1. Documentation Creation
Documentation is an essential part of any software development process, as it helps to ensure that projects can be effectively managed and maintained over time. To facilitate this, all engineering teams at 383 Project are required to create and maintain documentation for their projects. This documentation should be created using at least one or more of the following methods: Github using MD files, Jira, and Postman for documenting API endpoints. The following policy outlines the requirements and guidelines for creating and maintaining documentation at 383 Project.

### 1.1 Github
Documentation should be created within Github using Markdown files. Github provides a simple and intuitive way to create, share, and manage documentation. By creating documentation within Github, we can ensure that it is easily accessible and version controlled. Engineers are responsible for ensuring that documentation is properly created and maintained within Github.

### 1.2 Jira
Documentation related to specific project issues should be created and maintained within Jira. This includes all notes, comments, and attachments relevant to a particular issue. By linking documentation to specific issues within Jira, we can ensure that it is easy to find and review. Engineers are responsible for ensuring that documentation related to specific issues is properly created and maintained within Jira.

### 1.3 Postman
API endpoints should be documented using Postman. Postman provides a simple and intuitive way to document API endpoints, including their structure, parameters, and responses. By documenting API endpoints using Postman, we can ensure that they are easily accessible and can be easily updated as needed. Engineers are responsible for ensuring that API endpoints are properly documented within Postman.

## 2. Documentation Structure
All project documentation should follow the following structure:

- 2.1 Brief description of the project
- 2.2 Installation / Setup instructions
- 2.3 Short example / Tutorial
- 2.4 Highlight or link to an issue tracker or Jira board (where applicable)
- 2.5 Specify where the API documentation can be found (via Postman, if applicable)

This structure ensures that all documentation is consistent and easily understood by all stakeholders.

## 3. Responsibilities
Engineers are responsible for the following when it comes to project documentation:

- Creating and maintaining documentation within Github, Jira, and Postman as needed
- Ensuring that documentation is consistent with the guidelines set out in this policy
- Ensuring that documentation is easily accessible and properly version controlled
- Ensuring that documentation does not include any credentials or confidential information, but instead instructing where that information can be found
- Ensuring that documentation does not include any API keys, but instead instructing where they can be found
- Ensuring that documentation is accompanied by any necessary network and flow diagrams (Where applicable)

By following these guidelines for documentation creation and structure, we can ensure that project documentation is properly created, maintained, and accessible to all stakeholders. This will help to ensure the success of our projects and the continued growth and success of our organization.
