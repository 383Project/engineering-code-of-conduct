[<< Return to code of conduct homepage](https://github.com/383Project/engineering-code-of-conduct)

## Introduction

The Engineering Lifecycle document provides an overview of the structured process followed by our organization for the development and delivery of high-quality digital products. This document outlines the key stages, activities, and deliverables involved in the engineering lifecycle.

## Overview

The engineering lifecycle encompasses the end-to-end process of designing, developing, testing, and deploying digital products. It ensures that our products meet the highest standards of quality, security, and performance while adhering to industry best practices and client requirements.

## Stages of the Engineering Lifecycle

1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:**
   - This stage involves understanding client needs, business objectives, and project requirements.
   - Engineering teams collaborate with stakeholders to gather and analyze requirements, ensuring clarity and alignment.

2. **Design and Architecture:**
   - In this stage, engineering teams create the overall design and architecture for the digital product.
   - They define the system components, modules, interfaces, and data flows.
   - The design and architecture should consider scalability, security, and usability aspects.

3. **Development and Coding:**
   - The development stage involves writing code to implement the design and architecture.
   - Engineers follow best coding practices, coding standards, and version control procedures.
   - They leverage appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and libraries.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Quality assurance is an integral part of the engineering lifecycle.
   - Dedicated QA teams conduct various types of testing, including functional testing, integration testing, performance testing, and security testing.
   - Test cases, test scripts, and test data are prepared and executed to ensure the product meets quality standards.

5. **Deployment and Release:**
   - Once development and testing are completed, the digital product is prepared for deployment.
   - Deployment includes configuring and setting up infrastructure, such as cloud servers, databases, and networking components.
   - Engineers collaborate with DevOps teams to automate deployment processes and ensure a smooth release.

6. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - After deployment, the digital product is continuously monitored for performance, availability, and security.
   - Engineers proactively identify and address any issues or bugs that arise.
   - Regular maintenance activities, such as applying patches and updates, are performed to keep the product up to date.

7. **Iterative Development and Enhancements:**
   - The engineering lifecycle promotes an iterative and agile approach to product development.
   - Feedback from clients, end-users, and stakeholders is incorporated to drive enhancements and new feature development.
   - Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, may be utilized to manage development sprints and prioritize backlog items.

## Deliverables

Throughout the engineering lifecycle, various deliverables are produced to ensure proper documentation and communication. These may include:

- **Requirements Documentation:** Capturing and documenting client requirements, business objectives, and functional specifications.

- **Design and Architecture Documentation:** Artifacts detailing the overall system design, architectural components, and data flows.

- **Codebase:** Source code files and version control repositories containing the developed software.

- **Test Plans and Test Reports:** Documentation of test strategies, test cases, and test results to ensure quality assurance.

- **Deployment Documentation:** Instructions and configurations for deploying the digital product in different environments.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance Plans:** Documentation outlining the monitoring strategies, maintenance schedules, and support procedures.

- **Change Logs and Release Notes:** Records of changes made during development, including bug fixes, enhancements, and new features.

## Continuous Improvement

The engineering lifecycle promotes a culture of continuous improvement. Lessons learned from each project are captured, and feedback is incorporated into future development cycles. Retrospectives and post-project evaluations enable teams to identify areas for improvement and implement
