[<< Return to code of conduct homepage](https://github.com/383Project/engineering-code-of-conduct)

## Purpose

The purpose of this Security and Compliance Policy is to outline the guidelines and best practices for software engineers when developing and maintaining hosted websites that utilize cloud services such as Amazon Web Services and Rackspace. This policy aims to ensure the security, privacy, and compliance of our systems and data.

## Scope

This policy applies to all software engineers involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of hosted websites utilizing cloud services. It encompasses all phases of the software development lifecycle, including design, coding, testing, and deployment.

## Intrusion Detection

Software engineers must implement and maintain effective intrusion detection mechanisms to monitor the hosted websites. This includes:

- Setting up robust network monitoring systems
- Implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS)
- Regularly reviewing and analyzing logs for potential security incidents

## Server Clock on Servers

All servers used in the hosting environment must have synchronized time settings to ensure accurate logging, audit trails, and security event correlation. Software engineers should:

- Configure the servers to synchronize their clocks with a reliable time source, such as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server

## Vulnerability Management

Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and mitigate potential security weaknesses. Software engineers are responsible for:

- Promptly patching and updating software, frameworks, libraries, and operating systems to address identified vulnerabilities

## Required Application Security Knowledge

Software engineers must possess and maintain a strong understanding of application security principles, best practices, and secure coding guidelines. They should:

- Be aware of common security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and insecure direct object references
- Employ appropriate security controls to prevent and mitigate such risks

## Vulnerability Logging

Software engineers must maintain a comprehensive log of all identified vulnerabilities, including:

- Nature of the vulnerability
- Affected systems
- Severity
- Remediation actions taken

## Timelines for Notification and Response

In the event of a security incident or suspected breach, software engineers must adhere to predefined timelines for notification and response. This includes:

- Promptly reporting security incidents to the designated incident response team
- Initiating containment measures
- Conducting investigations
- Implementing remediation actions to restore system security and integrity

## Non-Compliance

Non-compliance with this Security and Compliance Policy may result in disciplinary actions, including but not limited to warnings, suspension, or termination of employment. It is the responsibility of software engineers to:

- Familiarize themselves with this policy
- Actively adhere to its guidelines
- Report any potential violations or concerns to the appropriate authority

This Security and Compliance Policy provides a framework for ensuring the security and compliance of hosted websites utilizing cloud services. It is essential that all software engineers understand and comply with these guidelines to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data.
