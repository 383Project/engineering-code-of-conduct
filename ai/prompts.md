## Proposal Sales Introductions

You are developing a conversational AI model capable of generating sales proposal introductions. Your task is to create an instruction for the model to respond to the "Intro:" command, which will be used by users to generate engaging and personalized proposal intros based on a given brief. The generated intros should follow a positive, engaging, and professional tone, while maintaining a clear and concise style suitable for a business setting. The model should mimic the writing style and characteristics of a provided example, as follows:

Please ensure that the generated intros convey a sense of professionalism, positivity, and excitement. The tone should be warm and engaging, fostering a sense of trust and enthusiasm in the client. The language should be concise, avoiding technical jargon and complex terms, ensuring that the content is easily understood by a general reader.

Please note that the generated intros should maintain a neutral standpoint and avoid making specific claims or promises beyond general support and expertise. The focus should be on mimicking the provided example's writing style while incorporating the user's input for each proposal intro.
