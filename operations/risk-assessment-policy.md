# Risk Assessment Policy

## Policy Statement

383 Project is committed to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with engineering activities to ensure the delivery of high-quality digital products. This Risk Assessment Policy establishes guidelines for conducting risk assessments and implementing risk mitigation measures within the engineering team.

## Objectives

The objectives of the Risk Assessment Policy are as follows:

1. Identify and assess potential risks that could impact the development and delivery of digital products.
2. Prioritize risks based on their likelihood and potential impact.
3. Implement measures to mitigate identified risks and minimize their impact.
4. Ensure compliance with ISO127001 and GDPR requirements.
5. Foster a culture of risk awareness and proactive risk management within the engineering team.

## Risk Assessment Process

1. Risk Identification:
   - Engineering managers assess project risks during estimation and planning, considering factors such as ability, resource availability, and capability within the team.
   - Engineers are responsible for highlighting security risks related to coding and raising any project risks to project managers and owners during the project's build.

2. Risk Analysis and Evaluation:
   - Risks are analyzed based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence.
   - Existing risk assessment methodologies and frameworks outlined in ISO27001 are followed to evaluate identified risks.

3. Risk Prioritization:
   - Risks are prioritized based on their severity, potential impact, and likelihood.
   - Focus is given to addressing risks with the highest potential impact and likelihood first.

4. Risk Mitigation:
   - Risk mitigation measures and action plans are developed for high-priority risks.
   - Engineering managers collaborate with the support team, product management, and data security office to implement appropriate controls and measures.
   - Measures include ensuring secure coding practices, conducting vulnerability scanning, and adhering to the prelaunch checklist.
   - All code is peer-reviewed within the team to identify and address potential flaws and issues.

5. Monitoring and Review:
   - Risks are continuously monitored to assess the effectiveness of implemented mitigation measures.
   - Regular assessments are conducted during new infrastructure setup and when new code is added.
   - Identified risks are documented and tracked in a risk register, which includes details such as risk description, impact, likelihood, assigned responsibilities, and mitigation status.
   - The data information security officer oversees the risk register and ensures that risks are appropriately addressed.

## User Authentication Requirements

1. Clearly define user authentication requirements, including the use of strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and periodic password changes.
2. Specify the procedures for granting and revoking user access privileges based on the principle of least privilege.

## Access Provisioning and Authorization Processes

1. Establish clear access provisioning and authorization processes for both business users and privileged or technical users.
2. Define roles and responsibilities for granting access rights and permissions.
3. Implement mechanisms to review and update access rights regularly, based on user needs and changes in job responsibilities.

## User Duties and Responsibilities

1. Inform users and operators of their duties and responsibilities in safeguarding the organization's assets and adhering to security policies and procedures.
2. Provide training and awareness programs to ensure users understand their roles in maintaining the security of digital products.

## Protection Needs of Assets

1. Identify and define the protection needs of the assets being developed, including availability, confidentiality, and integrity requirements.
2. Implement appropriate security controls to address these protection needs, such as encryption, access controls, and backups.

## Business Process Requirements

1. Determine security requirements derived from business processes, such as transaction logging, monitoring, and non-repudiation requirements.
2. Implement necessary controls to meet these requirements, ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and industry standards.

## Requirements Mandated by Other

1. Identify and address any requirements mandated by other security controls, such as interfaces to logging and monitoring systems or data leakage detection systems.
2. Implement necessary integrations and configurations to ensure compliance with these requirements.
