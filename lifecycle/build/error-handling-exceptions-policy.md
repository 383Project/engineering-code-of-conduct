# Error Handling Exceptions Policy

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that our software systems we build at 383 Project handle errors and exceptions in a consistent and effective manner, with the aim of minimizing system downtime, data loss, and user frustration. By implementing this policy, we can improve the reliability, security, and usability of our software products.

## Scope
This policy applies to all software systems and applications developed and maintained by our 383 Project.

## Error Handling and Exception Guidelines
To ensure that errors and exceptions are handled effectively, the following guidelines must be followed:

### 1. Error Logging
  - All errors and exceptions must be logged in a centralized error log that is accessible to authorized personnel. Where possible this should be contained within Bugsnag or Sentry at a minimum. If this is not possible text file logs should be available providing they are protected against public access.
  - Error logs must be reviewed and analyzed at least once annualy by the engineering support team to identify patterns and trends, and to prioritize error resolution.
  
### 2. Error Handling and Recovery
  - All errors and exceptions must be handled in a way that minimizes system downtime, data loss, and user frustration.
  - Where possible, systems should be designed to handle errors and exceptions automatically, without the need for user intervention. For example, the system could automatically retry failed operations, or switch to a backup system if a primary system fails.
  - Where user intervention is required, error messages must be clear and concise, and should provide guidance on how to resolve the error or exception.
  - In cases where data loss or corruption is possible, systems must have a mechanism for recovering data or rolling back transactions to a known good state.
 
### 3. Error Reporting
  - Clients must have a mechanism for reporting user errors and exceptions to the system administrators or support team through the Jira service desk. (This is subject to if a client has an active maintainance service with 383 Project).
  - The error reporting mechanism must be easy to use, and should prompt users to provide relevant information about the error or exception, such as the steps taken leading up to the error, and any error messages or codes displayed.
  
### 4. Security and Privacy
  - Error logs must be protected from unauthorized access or modification, and should be stored securely in a location separate from the primary system.
  - Error messages must not expose sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information.
  - In cases where errors or exceptions are caused by security breaches or attacks, appropriate security measures, such as intrusion detection and response systems, must be implemented.
