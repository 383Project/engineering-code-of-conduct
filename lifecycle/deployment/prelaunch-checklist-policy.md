# Prelaunch Checklist Poilicy

The Pre-Launch Checklist Policy is designed to ensure that every web application developed by our company goes through a thorough quality control process before it is released to the public. This policy outlines the guidelines for completing a pre-launch checklist, which includes tasks to be completed by the project team before the deployment of the application. The checklist is designed to identify and resolve any potential issues or vulnerabilities that may impact the performance or security of the application. By following this policy, we can ensure that every web application we release meets the highest standards of quality and security.

The prelaunch documents can and templates can be viewed here in the 383 Project Confluence area. [Prelaunch Checklist can be found here.](https://383project.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OS/pages/1579483164/Pre+Launch+Checklist)

## 1. Checklist Process
 - 1.1 The Pre-Launch Checklist must be created at the start of each project and must be completed throughout the software development lifecycle until the first release.
 - 1.2 The Project Manager must create the Pre-Launch Checklist and delegate tasks to the relevant Designer, Engineer, and QA leads.
 - 1.3 The Designer, Engineer, and QA leads must check-off the completed tasks within the checklist and @ themselves for verification purposes.
 - 1.4 Each completed table must be reviewed by a peer from their team or another qualified colleague, who will also @ themselves for verification.
 - 1.5 Any uncompleted checkboxes must be validated with the relevant Designer, Engineer or QA lead. If the check is non-applicable for the project, reference the detail in the Exclusion Details summary row, and ensure the relevant lead’s name has been applied against the task.
 - 1.6 The Project Manager is responsible for exporting the completed and validated checklist to a PDF and sending it via AdobeSign to the Head of Engineering for review and approval. If the Head of Engineering is unavailable, redirect the review and approval to the Operations Director or the next most senior Engineer available.
 - 1.7 Once approved, the Project Manager is responsible for exporting the signed PDF and creating a child page on the completed checklist within the project space. Attach the Signed PDF to the child page and title the page ‘Deployment Approval DDMMYYY.’ The link to the signed checklist page in Confluence should be sent to the Development Ops Manager as a deployment notice.
 - 1.8 For client-operated servers, a Detectify scan on the production site is required once live, and any issues must be resolved to the satisfaction of the client and 383’s Data Protection Officer.
 - 1.9 The Project Manager is responsible for exporting the updated Post-Deployment Security table to a PDF and sending it via AdobeSign to the 383’s Data Protection Officer for review and approval. If the 383’s Data Protection Officer is unavailable, redirect the review and approval to the Head of Engineering or the next most senior Engineer available.
 - 1.10 Once approved, the Project Manager is responsible for exporting the signed PDF and creating a child page on the completed checklist within the project space. Attach the Signed PDF to the child page and title the page ‘Security Approval DDMMYYY.’
 - 1.11 For future releases on the same platform, repeat the process in full by creating and embedding a new checklist section into the project and adding a new child page for the completed and approved PDF.
 - 1.12 For products in a cycle of continuous deployment in recurring windows, and using automated testing, this process is null and void post initial launch.
