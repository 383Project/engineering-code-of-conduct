# Software Requirements Specification Policy

Software development is a critical activity that requires careful planning and execution to ensure that the resulting software product meets the needs of its intended users. The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a key document in the software development process, as it sets out the requirements that the software must meet in order to be considered successful.

This policy is designed to provide guidance on how to create an effective SRS document. It outlines the various sections that should be included in the document, along with guidance on what should be included in each section. By following this policy, software engineers can ensure that the SRS document accurately reflects the needs of the software's intended users, and provides a clear roadmap for the development process.

You can start by creating a copy of the 383 Project SRS template which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19nqB44mCGkqrPqaw36W65zmzyJaBspB3r1XI2M6cdXU).

Note: That access to the above will require permission approval by Head of Engineering or a lead developer.

## 1. Introduction
- Provide a brief overview of the software application or system being developed, including its purpose and background information that may be relevant.

## 2. Purpose
- Describe the purpose of the Software Requirements Specification document and identify its intended audience.

## 3. Scope
- Define the scope of the software application or system being developed, including its features, functions, and capabilities.

## 4. Functional Requirements
- List and describe the functional requirements of the software application or system, including specific actions that the user should be able to perform and any output or results that should be generated.
- Use bullet points and examples to clarify the requirements.

## 5. Non-functional Requirements
- List and describe the non-functional requirements of the software application or system, including performance, security, or usability requirements.
- Use bullet points and examples to clarify the requirements.

## 6. User Interface Requirements
- Describe the intended user or user group for the software application or system, including any relevant demographics, skill levels, or accessibility requirements.
- Use bullet points and examples to clarify the requirements.

## 7. Assumptions and Dependencies
- List any assumptions or dependencies the software application or system relies upon, including any external systems, hardware, or software.
- Use bullet points and examples to clarify the requirements.

## 8. Constraints
- List any constraints that may impact the development or use of the software application or system, including any limitations on resources, time, or budget.
- Use bullet points and examples to clarify the requirements.

## 9. Use Cases
- Provide a set of use cases that describe how the software application or system will be used by its intended users.
- Each use case should describe a specific scenario and the steps required to complete it.
- Use bullet points and examples to clarify the requirements.

## 10. Functional Requirements Mapping
- Map each functional requirement to one or more use cases to ensure that all requirements are covered by at least one use case.
- Use bullet points and examples to clarify the requirements.

## 11. Acceptance Criteria
- List the acceptance criteria for each functional requirement and use case to ensure that the software application or system meets the specified requirements.
- Use bullet points and examples to clarify the requirements.

## 12. Glossary
- Provide a glossary of terms used throughout the Software Requirements Specification document to ensure that all readers understand the terminology used.
- Use bullet points and examples to clarify the requirements.

### Further Notes

- By following this policy, we can ensure that all software requirements are thoroughly documented and clearly defined, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project scope, objectives, and deliverables. This policy will help to minimize misunderstandings, delays, and rework, resulting in a more successful and efficient project outcome.

- When designing software, it's important to consider security requirements from the very beginning. This means that security must be considered during the design phase, rather than being added as an afterthought.

- Some security requirements that should be considered during the design phase include:
   -  Authentication and access control: Who is allowed to access the system, and what actions are they authorized to perform?
   -  Encryption: What data needs to be encrypted in transit and at rest?
   -  Logging and monitoring: How will you monitor the system for security incidents and track user activity?
   -  Error handling: How will the system handle errors and prevent information leakage?
   -  Input validation: How will the system validate input to prevent attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS)?

- By considering security requirements during the design phase, developers can build secure software from the ground up, rather than trying to patch security vulnerabilities later on. This can save time and money in the long run and ensure that the system is secure by design.
