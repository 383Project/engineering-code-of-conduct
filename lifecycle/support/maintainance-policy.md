# Server Maintenance Policy

[<< Return to code of conduct homepage](https://github.com/383Project/engineering-code-of-conduct)

## Purpose

The purpose of this Server Maintenance Policy is to define the procedures and guidelines for maintaining server hardware and software to ensure the reliability, availability, and security of server resources. This policy applies to all servers with an accompanying maintenance agreement, including physical and virtual servers, and all personnel responsible for server maintenance.

## Scope

This policy covers all aspects of server maintenance, including routine maintenance tasks, change management, security measures, and monitoring and reporting. 

## Responsibilities

The following individuals and teams are responsible for server maintenance:

- The Support Team: responsible for performing routine maintenance tasks, monitoring server performance, maintaining server hardware and software, implementing changes to server hardware and software, configuring servers, and ensuring server security.
- Third-party vendors or contractors: responsible for providing technical support, maintenance, or other services related to server hardware and software.

## Maintenance Schedule

A regular maintenance schedule is available to any client on agreement of a Maintenance Contract. A schedule for maintenance should be agreed upon with the client but it is the organisations recommendation to happen once every 3 months. Each maintenance schedule will be established for performing routine maintenance tasks, taking into account factors such as the criticality of server resources, the impact of downtime on business operations, and any maintenance windows that may be required to avoid disrupting users. Maintenance schedules should be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary.

## Maintenance Procedures

The following procedures must be performed regularly to ensure the reliability and availability of server resources:

- Hardware maintenance: To be conducted by AWS, and Rackspace.
- Software maintenance: Regular updates and patches should be applied to server software, including operating systems, applications, and other software components. Software maintenance tasks should include monitoring software performance, scanning for viruses and malware, and removing unnecessary software.
- Backups: Regular backups of server data should be performed to ensure that critical data is not lost due to hardware or software failures or human error. Backup procedures should include verifying backup data, storing backups securely, and testing backup restoration procedures.
- Monitoring: Regular monitoring of server performance should be performed to detect potential issues before they cause server downtime or data loss. Monitoring procedures should include setting up monitoring tools and alerts, tracking server performance metrics, and reviewing server logs for potential issues.
- Testing: Regular testing of server functionality should be performed to ensure that server resources are functioning as intended. Testing procedures should include testing server backups, stress testing servers, and testing recovery procedures.

## Change Management

Changes to server hardware and software should be managed through a formal change management process to ensure that changes are properly tested and validated before they are implemented. Change management procedures should include documenting changes, obtaining approval from stakeholders, testing changes in a non-production environment, and communicating changes to stakeholders.

## Security

Security measures should be taken during server maintenance to ensure that servers are properly secured before and after maintenance activities. Security measures should include:

- Applying all updates and patches promptly to maintain server security.
- Ensuring that all access to servers is properly authorized and authenticated.
- Implementing network segmentation and firewalls to control access to server resources.
- Encrypting sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access.
- Disabling unused services to reduce the attack surface.

## Monitoring and Reporting

Server performance should be monitored regularly to detect potential issues, and reports on server uptime, downtime, and maintenance activities should be generated regularly. Monitoring and reporting procedures should include setting up monitoring tools and alerts, tracking server performance metrics, and reviewing server logs for potential issues.

## Non-Compliance

Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or legal action.
