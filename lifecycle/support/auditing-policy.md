## Audit Process

1. Audit Planning:
   - The Engineering Audit Team, consisting of qualified individuals with expertise in engineering practices, plans and prepares for the audit.
   - The audit plan includes the scope, objectives, audit criteria, and the selection of auditors.

2. Audit Execution:
   - The auditors perform on-site or remote audits based on the established audit plan.
   - They conduct interviews, review documentation, and observe engineering practices to assess compliance and effectiveness.
   - Auditors may request additional information or evidence as needed.

3. Audit Findings and Reporting:
   - The audit team documents findings, including both strengths and areas for improvement.
   - Findings are categorized based on severity and prioritized for remediation.
   - A comprehensive audit report is prepared, highlighting the audit objectives, methodology, findings, and recommendations.
   - The report is shared with engineering teams and management.

4. Corrective Actions:
   - Engineering teams develop action plans to address identified findings and recommendations.
   - Action plans include specific tasks, responsible individuals, timelines, and measures for tracking progress.
   - The Engineering Audit Team monitors the implementation of corrective actions and provides guidance and support as needed.

5. Follow-up Audits:
   - Periodic follow-up audits are conducted to assess the effectiveness of corrective actions and track progress.
   - The frequency of follow-up audits is determined based on the severity of findings and the level of improvement required.

## Responsibilities

1. Engineering Teams:
   - Cooperate with auditors during the audit process by providing access to relevant information, systems, and personnel.
   - Participate in interviews and provide accurate and complete responses to auditor inquiries.
   - Take ownership of identified findings and actively contribute to the development and implementation of corrective actions.

2. Engineering Managers:
   - Support the audit process by facilitating access to resources, documentation, and personnel.
   - Ensure that corrective actions are assigned, tracked, and implemented within the specified timelines.
   - Foster a culture of continuous improvement by incorporating audit findings and recommendations into team practices.

3. Engineering Audit Team:
   - Plan and execute audits in accordance with the established audit plan and methodology.
   - Document findings and provide actionable recommendations to improve engineering practices.
   - Monitor the progress of corrective actions and conduct follow-up audits as required.
