#Infrastructure Backups and Restoration Policy

This policy document outlines the steps that our organization follows for managing the infrastructure of our web applications. One of the key elements of a robust infrastructure management system is the implementation of an effective backup and restoration policy. In this document, we will outline the various steps and processes that we follow for ensuring that our infrastructure is properly backed up and that we are able to restore it in the event of a disaster.
