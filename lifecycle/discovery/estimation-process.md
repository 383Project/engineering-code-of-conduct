# Process of creating a formal engineering estimation

A formal estimation is an essential aspect of the [383 Projects Engineering Code of Conduct](https://github.com/383Project/engineering-code-of-conduct). A formal estimation is a crucial document that provides accurate information on the cost, resources, and timelines required for a project. It is important to follow a well-defined process to create a comprehensive estimation that considers all aspects of the project. This process involves conducting a risk assessment, determining the necessary team composition, and granting access to non-engineering team members. By following this process, we can ensure that our estimations are accurate, reliable, and transparent.

## 1. Assess the Brief and Budget:
Ascertain if the brief is a realistic opportunity and has a valid budget for the anticipated work. If it's easily identifiable as a high-risk opportunity, this should be flagged to the commercial team straight away and the estimate should not be conducted unless instructed to by a commercial person.

## 2. Create a New Estimation Document:
If the opportunity is valid, create a new estimation document within Google Sheets. The template can be found here:
[Engineering Formal Estimation Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tOHUzsT2YZY_zwY8BW9uAdzCOIAdygUFn9zecYxsj_M/edit?usp=sharing)

For access you will need to speak with Head of Engineering or a Lead Engineer.

## 3. Enter Assumptions:
On the Estimation tab, write all the assumptions that you have made to make this estimation as accurate as possible.

## 4. Add Engineering Team Size:
In the Settings tab, under the "Engineering Team Size" heading, populate those quantities of the resource that is required.

## 5. Add Client Guide Budget:
In the Settings tab, under the "Client Guide Budget" heading, add the suggested or known budget for the work. This is for internal purposes only to measure if the opportunity is valid.

## 6. Populate Engineering Task Estimates:
On the Engineering Tasks tab, in the "Required Effort Days" column, enter the quantity of days required for each task. Then, in the "Resource Type" column, select the seniority and type of resource that is required. Do not change any of the calculated fields colored in grey, as these add calculated time for administrative team tasks. For each task, a confidence score can be attributed to each task, indicating how confident the team would be at delivering this task. Keep in mind any new technologies that the team might require to deliver the task.

## 7. Enter QA Tasks:
On the QA Tasks tab, complete the same steps as the Engineering Tasks tab.

## 8. Complete Risk Questionnaire:
On the Risk Questionnaire tab, complete the Yes and No questions to the best you can. If you have any supporting comments, add them to the relevant columns. If you are aware of any monetary risk, you can also add in this detail if known.

## 9. Populate Estimate Tab:
Return to the Estimate tab and populate the remaining content. Attach a link to your hosting estimate (If applicable).

## 10. Complete Notes and Recommendations:
On the Estimate tab, complete the notes and recommendations section and also complete the section "Estimation completed by."

## 11. Validate Estimate Against Budget:
Once you are happy with the estimation on the Estimate tab, you can then validate the estimate against the budget by clicking onto the Financial tab. You can see a comparison of a rough indication of your estimate, which is highlighted in green, against the client's budget, which is seen in red.

## 12. Review and Revise:
If the estimation is over 20% of the client's intended budget before sending it to a commercial team member, think about if there is any other approach that could be made to meet the client's needs and budget. If a different approach is made, you can always duplicate the estimation spreadsheet and share both options with the commercial contact.

## 13. Highlight Project Risk Score:
On the Estimate tab, if the Project risk score is below 50%, this should be highlighted to the commercial contact and raised again if the opportunity is pursued. The risk will also need to be recorded as the delivery stages of the project if the opportunity has been won.

Following these steps will help ensure that your estimation process is as accurate and efficient as possible, and will help you to produce estimates that are more likely to meet the client's expectations and budget.
