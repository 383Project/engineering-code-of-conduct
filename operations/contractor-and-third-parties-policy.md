- The selection process includes a screening call and paired programming exercises to assess technical capabilities.
- Performance and compliance are monitored through regular weekly 1:1 meetings, shared guidance documentation, and auditing of code activity on Github.
- Contractors are required to submit daily timesheets to track their time and activities.

## 3. Contractual Obligations

- Contractors and third-party providers must meet the technical requirements of the assigned tasks.
- They must adhere to the organization's core hours or pre-agreed hours and attend all required meetings and ceremonies.
- Collaboration with in-house engineers is mandatory.
- Continued satisfactory feedback throughout the contract duration is expected.

## 4. Security Considerations

- Contractors are provided with a personal email and Slack account for communication during their engagement, ensuring confidentiality and data protection.

## 7. Escrow Arrangements and Compliance Audits

- The organization retains access to Github history after the termination of the agreement, enabling monitoring of contractors' activity on the codebases.
- No specific escrow arrangements are currently in place.

## 8. Audit Rights and Controls
