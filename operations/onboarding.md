# New Starter Onboarding Policy
Welcome to 383 Project! We are excited to have you on board as a new team member. This policy outlines the onboarding process that we will take you through to ensure that you are set up for success.

## First Day:
On your first day, you will receive your equipment and will be introduced to the foundational processes of the business. You will also meet your line manager, who will guide you through the onboarding process.

## Cadet Camp:
We have a couple of days set aside for our Cadet Camp, which will help you to understand the 383 Project lifecycle and how we operate. During this time, you will have the opportunity to meet people from each department and learn more about their roles.

## Introduction to the Engineering Team:
You will be introduced to the Engineering Team, where you can connect with other members of the team.

## Line Manager Introduction and Onboarding:
Your line manager will introduce you to the tools and processes that you will be using on a daily basis. They will also draw up a short-term learning plan for you to address any immediate identified learning gaps.

## Engineering Udemy Learning Track:
You will have time to complete the Engineering Udemy Learning Track, which will help to build your skills and knowledge.

## Engineering Code of Conduct and Onboarding:
You will be provided with the Engineering Code of Conduct and Onboarding materials to read through and understand.

## Introduction to Engineering Team Leads:
Your line manager will set up introduction sessions for you to meet with each of the team leads within engineering to understand more about the engineering lifecycle.

## Skillsmap Setup and Learning Process:
You will have your Skillsmap setup and will be shown through the learning process.

## Weekly Ongoing 1:1s:
Your line manager will set up weekly ongoing 1:1s with you to check in on your progress and address any concerns.

## OKR Objectives:
Your line manager will walk through OKR Objectives with you and guide you on how to complete them, following up periodically.

## Immediate Upskilling Plan:
If required, your line manager will set up an immediate upskilling plan before you join your first team.

## Personal Onboarding Task/Plan:
As an engineer, you will be expected to produce a personal onboarding task/plan until you are ready to be onboarded into your first team or project.

## Check-ins with Head of Engineering:
At the one-month, three-month, and six-month marks, you will have check-ins with the Head of Engineering to discuss your integration into the team and any necessary role reviews

We hope that this policy helps you to understand the onboarding process and sets you up for success in your role at 383 Project.
