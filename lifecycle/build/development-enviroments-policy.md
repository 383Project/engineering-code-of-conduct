Secure Development Environment

The organisation has established and appropriately protects a secure development environment for system development and integration efforts that cover the entire system development life cycle. 
The development environment is configured identically to the production environments using a code repository to manage the resources created.
No Data in the development environment should be shared outside of that environment.
No personal data should be stored in the development environment.
No backups from any other environment should be restored to the development environment.
No backups are taken from the development environment.
No direct access to the development environment from any other environment and vice versa.
