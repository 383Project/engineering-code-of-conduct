# Infrastructure Monitoring Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of this Infrastructure Monitoring Policy is to establish guidelines and procedures for monitoring the organization's own and client infrastructure. This policy ensures system availability, performance optimization, proactive issue identification, and compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

## Scope

This policy applies to all team members involved in infrastructure monitoring within our organization. The policy covers the following monitoring technologies and services:

- StatusCake for monitoring the uptime performance of websites and reporting downtime incidents via Slack & Pager Duty.
- PagerDuty for reporting downtime, and SLA incidents to the Support Team.
- Detectify, when paid for by clients, for periodic OWASP Top 10 scans and reporting security vulnerabilities.
- Bespoke internal Server monitoring and cost monitoring tool for tracking resource utilization, cost forecasting, and reporting unusual activity or outages to the Support Team.
- Udemy for Business for providing security training materials to all engineers.
- Role-based access control for managing access to monitoring tools at appropriate levels.
- The Lead Support Engineer is responsible for the setup and configuration of monitoring services.

## Responsibilities

1. Lead Support Engineer:
   - Responsible for the installation and configuration of monitoring systems and tools.
   - Ensures that monitoring tools are appropriately integrated with the infrastructure components.
   - Defines monitoring objectives, metrics, and alerting thresholds based on best practices and organizational requirements.
   - Collaborates with team members to address and resolve monitoring-related incidents.

2. Infrastructure Monitoring Team:
   - Collaborates with the Lead Support Engineer in monitoring the infrastructure components.
   - Performs routine checks, analyzes performance metrics, and investigates anomalies or alerts generated by the monitoring tools.
   - Follows incident response procedures and escalates issues to the appropriate teams or individuals for resolution.
   - Assists in maintaining the documentation related to monitoring configurations and incident reports.

3. Engineers:
   - Utilize the monitoring tools to gain visibility into the performance and health of the infrastructure.
   - Monitor the relevant metrics and alerts for their respective areas of responsibility.
   - Collaborate with the Infrastructure Monitoring Team to address any identified issues or anomalies.

## Monitoring Process

1. Installation and Configuration:
   - The Lead Support Engineer is responsible for the installation and configuration of monitoring systems and tools.
   - Ensures that the monitoring systems are properly set up and integrated with the infrastructure components.

2. Uptime Monitoring:
   - Use StatusCake to monitor the uptime performance of websites.
   - Configure notifications via Slack to promptly alert the team about downtime incidents.

3. Incident Reporting:
   - Utilize PagerDuty for reporting downtime incidents to the Support Team.
   - Follow the defined incident reporting procedures for timely response and resolution.

4. Security Monitoring:
   - Employ Detectify, when paid for by clients, to perform periodic OWASP Top 10 scans and report security vulnerabilities.
   - Collaborate with security personnel to address and resolve identified security vulnerabilities.

5. Internal Server and Cost Monitoring:
   - Leverage the bespoke internal Server monitoring and cost monitoring tool to track resource utilization, cost optimization, and unusual activity or outages.
   - Configure alerts and notifications to promptly inform the Support Team about any anomalies or critical events.

6. Training and Awareness:
   - Utilize Udemy for Business to provide engineers with a wide range of security training materials.
   - Encourage engineers to enhance their knowledge and skills in monitoring best practices and security measures.

7. Access Management:
   - Implement role-based access control mechanisms to manage access to monitoring tools at appropriate levels.
   - Grant access privileges based on job responsibilities and requirements.

## Non-Compliance and Consequences

Non-compliance with this Infrastructure Monitoring Policy may result in data loss, compromised system security, or regulatory violations. Non-compliant individuals may be subject to disciplinary action.

By following this Infrastructure Monitoring Policy, we ensure consistent and secure logging practices, protect log data integrity, and maintain compliance with data protection requirements.
