# Engineering Code Of Conduct

Welcome to this comprehensive document that covers all critical processes within Engineering development. As you read through, you will find a detailed description of the engineering processes of the engineering development lifecycle. This document outlines the essential steps that are involved in the development of engineering projects, ensuring that you have a clear understanding of each phase.

We have also included an in-depth explanation of risk process assessments, highlighting their importance in mitigating potential project risks. Additionally, we provide you with a thorough understanding of the basic operating procedures for engineering, ensuring that you have a solid foundation for successful project completion.

Furthermore, we have included information on the best secure coding practices that are essential in maintaining the security and integrity of your engineering projects. This document is designed to provide you with a complete understanding of all the critical processes involved in engineering development, ensuring that you have the knowledge and skills needed to successfully complete your engineering projects.

- ### The Development Lifecycle
  The engineering lifecycle refers to the series of processes and activities that an engineering project undergoes from its conceptualization and design to its development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.    

  - #### Discovery
    Discovery in the engineering lifecycle refers to the initial phase of the project where requirements are gathered, the problem is defined, and the feasibility of the project is assessed to determine whether it is worth pursuing. The following information for discovery is for a guide purpose only as not every project requires these documents this varies to a project complexity and needs.
