# Infrastructure Quote Process Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the guidelines and procedures for the infrastructure estimation process. This policy covers the estimation process for infrastructure created and managed through AWS Cloud Services, utilizing our own Hosting infrastructure calculator.

## Scope

This policy applies to all members involved in the infrastructure estimation process, including senior engineers, the lead support engineer, finance team members, and commercial teams responsible for issuing quotes to clients.

## Estimation Process

The infrastructure estimation process follows the steps outlined below:

1. Initial Assessment of Project Outcomes:
   - A senior engineer or higher reviews the requirements of the client, and estimates the best possible solution to suit their needs, preparing all the necessary details required for the estimation.

2. Meeting and Data Gathering:
   - The aforementioned engineer organizes a meeting with the lead support engineer to discuss and break down the details further.
   - During the meeting, the lead support engineer collects any additional information, clarifies requirements, and ensures a thorough understanding of the needed infrastructure to facilitate the developed project.
   - The lead support engineer documents all the gathered information to be used in the infrastructure estimation.

3. Calculation and Validation:
   - The lead support engineer utilizes the information collected and enters it into our Hosting Infrastructure Calculator.
   - The calculation requires information such as expected usage, anticipated workload, desired AWS services, and any specific requirements.
   - A Google Sheet is created and contains an itemised breakdown of costs for the infrastructure estimation along with a glossary and reasons for the inclusion of specific AWS services.
   - The lead support engineer reviews and validates the information and calculations to ensure accuracy.

4. Finance Approval:
   - The lead support engineer submits the estimated infrastructure cost to the finance team for approval.
   - The finance team reviews the estimation, considering any markup or additional services required.
   - Once finance approves the estimation, it proceeds to the next step.

5. Quote Generation:
   - With the finance-approved estimation, the finance team provides the finalized infrastructure estimation to the commercial teams.
   - The commercial teams use the estimation to create a quote for the client, including pricing, services, and terms.

## Non-Compliance

Non-compliance with this policy may result in delays in the estimation process, inaccuracies in infrastructure estimations, financial discrepancies, and potential negative impact on client relations. Non-compliant individuals may be subject to disciplinary action.

By following this Infrastructure Estimation Process Policy, we ensure a standardized and efficient approach to estimate infrastructure costs accurately and provide reliable quotes to our clients.
