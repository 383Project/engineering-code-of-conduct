# Technical Debt Recording Policy
At 383 Project, we recognize that technical debt is an inevitable aspect of software development. To ensure that technical debt is properly managed and addressed, this policy outlines the guidelines for recording technical debt. This policy applies to all software development projects undertaken by 383 Project.

## 1. Technical Debt Recording Guidelines
- 1.1 All technical debt when identified must be identified and recorded via Jira against the project we are running for the client.
- 1.2 Technical debt should be classified and prioritized based on its potential impact on the project, including its effect on the software development process, user experience, and product performance. As a 383 project engineer you are responsible for raising awareness of technical debt along with the risk and issues around its impact on the project.
- 1.3 Technical debt should be recorded with a description of the issue, its root cause, and any relevant documentation or information that will aid in its resolution.
- 1.4 Technical debt should be assigned to the appropriate team member for resolution within the product team, and the status of each technical debt item should be tracked and updated regularly.
- 1.5 Technical debt should be periodically reviewed within the product team to ensure that it remains relevant and to determine if it requires additional action.
- 1.6 Technical debt should be resolved as part of regular development sprints, and the resolution of technical debt should be given priority equal to that of feature development.
- 1.7 Any technical debt that cannot be resolved within the project's timeline should be escalated to the project manager for further review and prioritisation.

This policy will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis by the Engineering Team to ensure that it remains relevant and effective.

By following this policy, we can ensure that technical debt is properly managed and addressed, minimizing its impact on project timelines, product quality, and overall software development.
